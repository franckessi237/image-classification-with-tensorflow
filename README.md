# Image Classification with Deep Learning

## Project Overview

In this project, we aim to build a deep learning model to classify images into several categories using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 classes, including airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, and truck.

To achieve our goal, we employ three essential deep learning approaches:

1. **Model Development with Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)**: We first create a basic neural network model to classify images.
2. **Design of a More Advanced Deep Learning Model, the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**: We then develop a CNN, which is more suitable for image classification tasks due to its ability to capture spatial hierarchies in images.
3. **Transfer Learning**: Finally, we leverage a pre-trained model (VGG16) and adapt it to our specific classification task, which allows us to utilize learned features from a large-scale dataset like ImageNet.

## Dataset

The CIFAR-10 dataset is used for this project. It is divided into 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images. Each image is a 32x32 pixel color image, categorized into one of the following 10 classes:
- Airplane
- Automobile
- Bird
- Cat
- Deer
- Dog
- Frog
- Horse
- Ship
- Truck

## Approach

### 1. Model Development with Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)

We start by creating a basic MLP model with the following architecture:
- **Flatten Layer**: Converts 3D image inputs into 1D vectors.
- **Dense Layers**: Two fully connected layers with 128 and 64 neurons, respectively, using the ReLU activation function.
- **Output Layer**: A final dense layer with 10 neurons and a softmax activation function for classification.

### 2. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

To improve performance, we design a more advanced CNN model with the following architecture:
- **Convolutional Layers**: Two convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers to extract features.
- **Flatten Layer**: Converts the 2D feature maps into a 1D vector.
- **Dense Layers**: A fully connected layer with 128 neurons and ReLU activation, followed by a dropout layer to prevent overfitting.
- **Output Layer**: A final dense layer with 10 neurons and softmax activation.

### 3. Transfer Learning

We utilize the VGG16 model pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset:
- **Base Model**: Load VGG16 without the top classification layers and freeze its weights.
- **Custom Classification Head**: Add custom layers on top of VGG16, including global average pooling, dense layers, dropout, and a final softmax output layer for classification.

## Implementation Details

### Libraries and Dependencies

- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib**: For plotting and visualization.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: For building and training deep learning models.

### Environment

This project was developed and executed on **Google Colab**, which provides a cloud-based environment with GPU support, making it suitable for training deep learning models efficiently.

### Training and Evaluation

- **Training**: Models are trained using the CIFAR-10 training set with appropriate batch sizes and epochs.
- **Evaluation**: Models are evaluated on the CIFAR-10 test set to determine accuracy and loss.

### Results

- **MLP Model**: Provides a baseline performance for image classification.
- **CNN Model**: Shows improved performance over the MLP model by leveraging convolutional layers.
- **Transfer Learning**: Utilizes VGG16 for advanced feature extraction and achieves high classification accuracy with fine-tuning.

**Model Accuracy on Test Data**: The final model achieved a precision of 0.712 (or 71.2%) on the CIFAR-10 test set.

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation**: Load and preprocess the CIFAR-10 dataset.
2. **Model Training**: Train the MLP, CNN, and transfer learning models.
3. **Evaluation**: Assess the models' performance and visualize results.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the effectiveness of various deep learning techniques for image classification. By leveraging MLPs, CNNs, and transfer learning, we can achieve robust image classification results on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

## Future Work

- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Experiment with different hyperparameters for further performance improvements.
- **Data Augmentation**: Apply techniques to increase the diversity of the training data.
- **Advanced Models**: Explore more advanced architectures and transfer learning techniques.
